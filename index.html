                I attended the University of central Florida for about four years pursuing<br> 
            a degree in Digital Media on the Game Design track.  In my studies I worked<br>
            in various fields I studied fine art, computer science, coding, and design.<br>
            all culminating to my game design upper level courses.  
        </p>
        <p>  

                In these courses I worked on various teams developing games and software <br>
            from scratch.  Typically I worked as the lead artist or design lead but <br>
            In these smaller settings it was necesarry for us to branch out and contri- <br>
            bute to various sections of the development process.  In the section below I detail <br>
            some of my past projects.

        <h4> Robot Rigatoni </h4>
        </div>

        <div class = 'project_1'>
        <p> 
                 
                In the near future where old service droids are set out to pasture, one robot <br>
            decides to hunt bounty on the Martian Dune.  Armed with plasmalero pistols he is <br>
            ready to challenge any opponenet in his way.  "Robot Rigatoni" aims to blend sci fi <br>
            and western aesthetics while maintaining a playful tone.  Using common tropes, vibrant <br>
            colors, and creative character design to blend characteristics of each genre.

                I worked as the lead artist on this project as well as creative director.  We had <br>
            a team of four people and it took us about four months to develop.  It was tailored <br>
            to work on an arcade cabinet.  So the controls and so forth are tailored towards <br>
            joysticks and multiplayer play.

                In this twin stick shooter you play a lone survivor in a city filled with the <br>
                "the sick", infected humans who crave flesh.  You are attempting to find a cure <br>
                and escape the city before turning into one of them yourself.   `X
